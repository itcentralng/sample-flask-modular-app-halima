# Step 1

create .env file, config.py, run.py

## Step 2

create a folder App

### Step 3

create a file in the app **\_init**.py

#step 4
In run.py, run your app using the following:
from app import app

if **name** == "**main**":
app.run()

#step 5
In .env file, enter the following:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql:///practical_db
SECRET_KEY=someserioussecret

#step 6
in the config.py, import os and the write the following:

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')

#step 7
create virtual environment and activate

#step 8
make all necesarry installations:
flask
marshmallow
migrate
flask sqlalchemy

#step 9
in the **init**.py file, do the following:
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(**name**)

@app.get('/')
def index():
return "Welcome to our app"

#step 6
In thunderclient, test to see if index endpoint is working first by running flask...
NB:it required the following; There are .env or .flaskenv files present. Do "pip install python-dotenv" to use them.

#step 7
add the importations of sqlachemy,marshmallow and migrate to the **init**.py file while including config files:

from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_marshmallow import Marshmallow
from flask_migrate import Migrate
import os

app = Flask(**name**)
app.config.from_object('config')
app.secret_key=os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
ma = Marshmallow(app)
migrate = Migrate(app, db)

#step 8
create a database in postgresql and give it a name from the name in the .env file... in this case, practical_db

#step 9
create a folder inside app folder and call it user, and inside the user folder, create three files...one for endpoints,database and schema each(controller,model and schema). Inside user, create an **init**.py file

#step 10
in the model.py, create a model...start by importing db from app
then create functions that will be used to save,update,set and validate password,then create a class method that will be accessed in the controller

#step 11
create blueprint and routes by doing the following:
from flask import Blueprint,request

from app.user.model import User

user = Blueprint("user",**name**,url_prefix="/user")

@user.post('/login')
def login():
username = request.json.get('username')
password = request.json.get('password')
if username and password:
user = User.get_by_username(username)
if user and user.is_valid(password):
return 'Login succcessful'
return 'User not found', 401

@user.post('/register')
def register():
username = request.json.get('username')
password = request.json.get('password')
if username and password:
user = User.create(username, password)
return 'Registration succcessful', 200
return 'Username and Password Required', 400

#step 12
register blueprint in the **init**.py file;
from app.user.controller import user
app.register_blueprint(user)

#step 13
run pip install psycopg2-binary then,
run $flask db init, $flask db migrate -m "Initial migration" and $flask db upgrade in terminal then run using "flask run --debug" and test with thunder client

#corrections

1. used a wrong port which was changes
2. didnt add name which was not nullable which i added to the cls
3. needed to check password before saving
